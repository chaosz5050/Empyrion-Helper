# Empyrion-Helper
A Linux UI tool to do admin tasks for a dedicated Empyrion server
I noticed there is a very nice tool EAH for Windows. While I am not able to recreate that in Linux, I can hopefully still make something useful.
The app is meant for personal use, but I will share it here. Perhaps someone has use for it :)

In the past I have coded in C# (without AI) and now I am vibe-coding in Python. And no it's not done in 5 minutes like some TikTokkers will let you to believe. It still takes many hours of building propers prompts, troubleshoot (AI doesn't catch all errors!)
Hopefully I can upload something working within 1 or 2 weeks from now (Juli 2nd 2025)

What I have working so far:

- Reading online players
- Banning or kicking a player
- Reading all entities
